# Programming-Foundations-Software-TestingQA

### - Course details

Quality assurance (QA) engineering can mean many different things to different people. In this course, learn about QA practices within the context of a software engineering project. Instructor Meaghan Lewis demonstrates the different kinds of testing QA focuses on and how QA fits into the software development life cycle (SDLC). Meaghan explores the areas you'll likely want to test and continuously monitor to ensure increasing improvements to your product. Plus, she goes over some of the mechanisms used to communicate the overall health of a product. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll be able to look at whatever you're working on, think critically about how the pieces fit together, and identify ways to help your team meet quality goals with every release.
